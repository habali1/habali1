# About Me

Hi it's Huseyin. I'm a highly motivated and versatile **Computer Science** and **Information Systems Engineering** student currently enrolled in a dual diploma program at **Binghamton University** and **Istanbul Technical University (ITU)**. With a passion for problem-solving and a foundation in both **C/C++** and **Python**, I've developed a diverse portfolio of projects that demonstrate my ability to tackle complex challenges, whether itâ€™s in software development, data structures, algorithms, or low-level system programming.

## What I Bring to the Table

- **Programming Languages**: Proficient in C, C++, Python, and familiar with x86 assembly.
- **Problem-Solving**: Strong analytical skills with the ability to break down complex problems into manageable parts.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Experience in implementing and optimizing various data structures, such as linked lists, trees, heaps, and custom floating-point representations.
- **Systems Programming**: Solid understanding of memory management, buffer overflow exploits, and control flow analysis.
- **Software Development**: Developed command-line tools, games, and automated testing frameworks.
